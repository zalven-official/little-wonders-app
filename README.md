### Phil-IRI Post Test

The Philippine Informal Reading Inventory (Phil-IRI) Post Test is an assessment tool used at the end of an instructional period to measure and describe students' reading performance. It provides valuable information to teachers regarding students' progress in reading skills, both in oral and silent reading contexts. The results can be compared to pre-test outcomes to determine the effectiveness of the reading instruction and identify areas that may require further intervention.

#### Components of the Phil-IRI Post Test:

1. **Grade Level Assessment**:
   - The assessment is tailored to different grade levels, ensuring the reading material is appropriate for the student's instructional level.
   - It evaluates the student's ability to read texts that align with their grade-specific expectations.

2. **Oral Reading**:
   - Involves the student reading a passage aloud.
   - Assesses fluency, accuracy, pronunciation, and expression.
   - Helps identify issues with phonemic awareness, decoding, and immediate comprehension.
   - Teachers can observe the student's ability to read with appropriate pacing and intonation.

3. **Silent Reading**:
   - The student reads a passage silently.
   - Focuses on comprehension, retention, and the ability to infer meaning from the text.
   - Allows students to read at their own pace without the pressure of oral performance.
   - Teachers can gauge understanding through follow-up questions and activities related to the text.

#### Sample Post Test Passages:

**Grade 2 Oral Reading Passage**:
